PROJECT SUMMARY
===============

Brief Decription
----------------
This software is designed to simulate a 2D fluid flow system using a space 
and time discretisation of the Navier-Stokes and conservation of momentum 
equations. System boundaries are implemented using the Lennard-Jones 
Potential for repulsion to prevent particles from leaking. Timestepping 
is adaptive to guarantee CFL stability.

Goals Achieved
--------------
1 - SPH simulation with Forward Euler and Predictor-Corrector time stepping
    methods.

2 - SPH simulation including artificial pressure.

3 - Comparison between SPH simulator and real life shallow water velocities.

4 - Check for Impact of varying the smoothing length (h) factor and choice
    of velocity of sound in water.

Lesson Learned
--------------
1 - Effective usage of git and git-hub for group programming.

2 - Team working skills.

3 - Software development best practice (Usage of Travis, Sphinx, etc).

4 - Time management.
