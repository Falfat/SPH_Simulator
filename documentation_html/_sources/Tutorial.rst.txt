SPH Simulator Tutorial
======================

This is a short description on how to use the SPH simulator software.

Installation
------------
The software should be used as python modules in your local folder. 
In your python project import the modules as:

import sph_fe as sphfe
import sph_ie as sphie
import sph_ap as sphap

Requirements
------------
To be able to run this software, the following packages and versions 
are required:

numpy >= 1.15.4
scipy >= 1.1.0
matplotlib >= 3.0.2
mpltools >= 0.2.0
sympy >= 1.3
pandas >= 0.23.4


Usage
-----
The three modules provide different methods and adaptations to timestepping 
the Navier-Stokes equations.

sph_fe: provides a forward euler timestepping, with Lennard-Jones boundary 
	repulsion (optimised)
sph_ie: provides an improved predictor-corrector timestepping method with 
	Lennard-Jones boundary repulsion
sph_ap: provides the same predictor-corrector timestepping method, with 
	Lennard-Jones boundary repulsion and inserted artificial pressure to 
	prevent tensile instability.

The simulation can be easily run using the sph_simulation function, common 
amongst all modules. The simulator requires the user to specifcy a minimum 
and maximum coordinate (in meters) of the system domain, a time frame 
(in seconds) and a function that specifies the initial position of particles 
of the domain with a boolean output. Other parameters are optional and if 
not specified will be used as the default setting (SPH_Documentation).
