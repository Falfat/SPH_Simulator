    "At each time step, ten particles attribute need to be updated along with the time step itself. The atrributes are:\n",

    "The following section will introduce how Forward Euler and Predictor Corrector (also called Improved Euler) method are implementing these changes through the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Forward Euler\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial implementation of the SPH simulator uses a Forward Euler timestepping scheme. It timesteps the particle's position, velocity and density. This timestepping method is used in `sph_fe`. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{x}_{i}^{t+1} = {x}_{i}^{t} + {\\Delta t}{v}_{i}^{t}\\\\\\\\\n",
    "{v}_{i}^{t+1} = {v}_{i}^{t} + {\\Delta t}{a}_{i}^{t}\\\\\\\\\n",
    "{\\rho}_{i}^{t+1} = {\\rho}_{i}^{t} + {\\Delta t}{D}_{i}^{t}\\\\\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow chart below is a visual representation of the different operations takinf place during each timestep of the SPH simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./report_diagrams/fwd_euler.png\" width=500x>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Forward Euler gives promising results and allows for a good visualisation of the flow's behaviour. It however require very small time step in order to work and is only first order accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimisation of the `finding neighbours` method was implemented in `sph_fe`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Predictor-Corrector Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and improved implemtation of the SPH simulator makes use of an Imporoved Euler time stepping schemes. This time stepping solution is second order accurate, and is used in both file `sph_ie` and `sph_ap`. The `sph_ap` module has additional methods, to implement the artificial pressure on the SPH simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Predictor Corrector method takes the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./report_diagrams/imp_euler.png\" width=500x>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge of implementing this method was saving the temporary value for particle i and j. While different lists were cosidered, the best implementation was to add `x_temp`, `v_temp` and `rho_temp` as attributes of the particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "These additions included adding a few changes to the main code, such as adding a `step` parameter to the `dW` function. This is because in the second step, when `a`, `D`, `dW` and LJ forces are calculated in the double for loop, the value of x that needs to be considered for `r_ij` and `v_ij` is that `x_temp`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation worked easily and required little changes to the main code. \n",
    "\n",
    "For further improvements to the Predictor Corrector method, the two for loops should be made into methods that are called for the two stages of the PC timestepping. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Find Neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "A find_neighbours was given and used for early simulations. This method worked well, however as the largest time restraint on this simulation is looping over all neighbours for all particles we should look to optimise the code here. As the derivative equations are either symmetric (density) or anti-symmetric (velocity) we can consider the interaction of particle i on particle j abd the interaction of particle j on particle i at the same time. This halves the nuber of particles we have to iterate over and improves run time by $\\sim40-50\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new method developped here, is implemented by only considering half of the particles neightbours, requiering a new find_neighbours function where only the highlighted grid points below are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./report_diagrams/l_shape.png\" width=200x>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "we also need to consider the centre grid cell neighbours, however we must be careful to only consider each particle pair once (i.e. we need an asymetrical criteria so that we include the interaction when looking at particle i but not when looking at particle j). The best way to gaurentee this is used the particles ID numbers: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if ID_i > ID_j:\n",
    "    consider interaction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is computationally cheap (they are only ever relativly small integers) and ensures the interactions will never be considered twice. In terms of equations whenever we add one of the summations terms to the accleration of particle i we also subtract it from particle j and we add the density term to both i and j as well. The only other algorithmic change this requiers is to reset the deriatives for all particles at the end of a timestep so we can add sumattion terms for any particle in the next step before they are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grid Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid allocation was immproved to suit better with a front end code. The new gird initialisation works by running a series of methods in the main class. This new method also ensures that there are no overlapping particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user input to create the grid consists of \n",
    "- x_max, upper corner of the domain\n",
    "- x_min, lower corner of the domain\n",
    "- f(x, y), which gives coordinates a value of 1 when a particle is present and 0 when the spaceis empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The f(x, y) function is written as inequalities for the case example, such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " def f(x, y):\n",
    "    if 0 <= y <= 2 or (0 <= x <= 3 and 0 <= y <= 5):\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic flow of the grid initialisation is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./report_diagrams/init_grid.png\" width=500x>\n",
    "\n",
    "where 3 method set up the grid:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Lennard-Jones potential Boundary Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "LJ forces were added to the calculations. This implementation adds an acceleration component to particles that are within desired distance to the wall to push them back into the domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The desired distance is computed by ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{q}_{ref} = \\frac{{d}_{ref}}{{r}_{wall-normal}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d_{ref}$ is a set fraction of the $dx$ set by the user, and ${r}_{wall-normal}$ is the perpendicular distance between the particle and the wall.If the ratio is larger than one, the LJ force are added to the acceleration of the particle.\n",

    "This boundary control was extensively tested and proved to work beyond expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leakage Damage Control\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was implemented early on the code and were used as a initial control for leakages. It consists of checking wether a particle: - has neighbours, and -is within the grid domain. If the particle does not go through this validation it is earased for the domain particle list. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Particle Object \n",

    "## Saving\n",
    "\n",
    "When the system is initialised a config.txt file is saved which holds all the system parameters the save was run for. Then a csv file is opened which is appended to at a user specified frequency. The csv is set up into a readable column format, which allows for easy reading by the pandas library. This means if the user decided to stop the simulation early all data up to that point is still saved, and with the possible extension of checkpointing the config file could be used to re-setup the system. This would give the user large felexibility with our code.\n",

    "# <span style=\"color:blue\"> 6. Further Improvements</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the development of this SPH simulation ran we had a limited amount of time. The simulator modules are consitant and sustainable, hence further research and improvements should be simple to do. In particluar further research on the results is key as the lond run times of singificant resolution simulations meant we did not have enough time to inspect the results very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convergence Test\n",
    "Convergence test should be performed as part of the sustainabilty of the code and the results. There are two possible ways we could implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Compare the wave crest time development to those expected from the simple wave equation. To do this one could either run a very wide simulation so the crest can be analysed both before it reflects off a boundary or the time period of the crest moving across the domain could be checked both for consistency and compared to the wave equations predictions. By varying dx and looking at the errors with respect to these criteria at a specified time should give a reasonable convergence plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Check the consistency of known conversion laws, for example conservation of energy. The possiblilty of particles leaking and the impact of the boundary Lenard-Jones potential on this would need to be carefully considered before an analysis of this type could be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing checkpointing (~ 2hr)\n",
    "We already made the system save a configuration file of the system object instances values at the start of the simulaiton. Using this with any of the time snaps saved (in the csv file) one could load the system to futher simulate. This would likely take the form of an external funciton that would take the config, data file names and return a instance of the system class setup with the particles and system parameters ready to be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimisation (~5 hr)\n",
    "Currently we have only done the half neighbours optimisation for Forward Euler, this should be added to the improved euler and artifical pressure versions of the code need to be updated with this. There are also other optimisations that could be implemented, these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completely ignoring boundary particles with no non-boundary particle neighbours as the relative positions and velocities can't have changed (all boundary particles are fixed) and hence they can be ignored. These include all of the boundary partilces in the upper half of the domain, significantly reducing the number of particles to iterate over, so would give some significant improvements\n",
    "- Not finding acceleration for any boundary particles, as they always remain fixed. This would reduce the number of calculations for these particles so provided a minor improvement\n",
    "- locally store relative particle positions as these are being calculated once to find neighbours and once to find the kernal funciton value. Again this reduces number of calculations for these particles so provided a minor improvement.\n",
    "- Beyond this running a profiler to further improve the code could be done\n",
    "\n",
    "All these improve run time but none to the extent of the half neighbour method so were given a lower priortiy and not finished within the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further analysis of results (~3hr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the data and tracing the path and property change of single particles for different system parameters would provided a good insight into the impact these parameters have on the simulation. Combining this with the overall trends of the system we could look with more detail into how $C_0$ and $h_fac$ impact the results and combination with previously described convergence tests could show which settings are most realistic."
